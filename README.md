I am Bo Lui and I welcome you to Sir Brendan's financial tracker to track how deep your pockets are! Sir Brendan is my creator.

I am your personal finance bot! I store your spendings and earnings in a simple way.

For now, I am in the beta stages and so, I have very limited functionalities. I may crash on you. I probably will crash on you... But! Your opinion and feedback to the creator will surely improve my system, so thank you for using me! 

I keep track of your spendings and earnings in a very straight forward way. You can enter your entries with commands /spend or /earn. To view your inputted entries, type /entries. 

Made a mistake while inputting an entry? Type /cancel to reset it.

For now, I cannot edit your created entries or even delete them! Don't worry though, I will soon :)


Last thing, I will sometimes echo your latest message...
